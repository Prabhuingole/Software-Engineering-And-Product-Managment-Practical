 1. Project Estimation using COCOMO Practical 2
Since your project is a web application with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB), it falls under the Organic Mode of COCOMO.

Estimated Parameters:
Lines of Code (LOC): Approx 5,000 - 10,000 LOC
Type of Project: Organic (small team, simple requirements, few complexities)
Effort (E), Time (T), and People Required (P) are calculated using Basic COCOMO Model.
📌 2. Basic COCOMO Model
The Basic COCOMO formulae for Organic Mode are:

1️⃣ Effort (E) = 2.4 × (KLOC)^1.05 (Person-Months)
2️⃣ Time (T) = 2.5 × (E)^0.38 (Months)
3️⃣ People Required (P) = E / T

Where:

KLOC = Estimated thousands of lines of code (e.g., 5 KLOC = 5000 LOC)
Estimation Example for Your Project
Let’s assume 7 KLOC (7000 LOC) for your web app:

1️⃣ Effort (E) = 2.4 × (7)^1.05 = 18.12 Person-Months
2️⃣ Time (T) = 2.5 × (18.12)^0.38 = 7.8 Months
3️⃣ People Required (P) = 18.12 / 7.8 ≈ 2.3 People

Thus, approximately 2–3 developers working for 7–8 months would complete the project. If you have a larger team, time can be reduced.

📌 3. Project Cost Estimation
Suppose the average developer salary is $3000 per month
Total Cost = Effort × Monthly Salary
18.12 Person-Months × $3000 = $54,360
This is just an estimation; actual costs may vary based on team size, location, and technologies used.

📌 4. Advantages & Drawbacks of COCOMO
✅ Advantages:
✔ Simple & Easy to Use – Only requires LOC estimation.
✔ Provides Cost & Time Estimates – Helps in planning resources.
✔ Works Well for Small & Medium Projects – Like your web application.

❌ Drawbacks:
✖ Relies on LOC Estimation – Hard to predict accurately for dynamic web applications.
✖ Does Not Consider Modern Development Methods – Agile & CI/CD pipelines aren’t accounted for.
✖ Does Not Include Non-Coding Efforts – UI/UX design, testing, and deployment efforts aren’t factored in.

📌 5. Alternative Approaches for Estimation
If you want a more accurate estimate, consider:
🔹 Function Point Analysis (FPA) – Estimates based on features & complexity
🔹 Use Case Points (UCP) – Good for web applications
🔹 Agile Story Points – Better for modern software development

Project Estimation Using Basic COCOMO Model
1. Introduction to COCOMO Model
The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a widely used software cost estimation model developed by Barry W. Boehm in 1981. It helps in estimating effort, time, and cost required for software development based on the project's size (measured in KLOC – thousands of lines of code).

The COCOMO model is divided into three types:

Basic COCOMO – Estimates based only on KLOC.
Intermediate COCOMO – Considers additional cost drivers like experience, complexity, etc.
Detailed COCOMO – Provides phase-wise effort distribution.
For this project, we use Basic COCOMO, which applies mathematical formulas based on the project category.

2. Basic COCOMO Model
Basic COCOMO classifies projects into three categories:

Organic – Small, simple projects with experienced developers.
Semi-Detached – Medium complexity, moderate experience.
Embedded – Complex, high-security systems with strict requirements.
For a Travel Agency Management System, it falls under the Organic category.

Formulas for Basic COCOMO
For an Organic project, the estimation formulas are:

Effort (E) = 2.4 × (KLOC)^1.05 (in person-months)
Time (T) = 2.5 × (E)^0.38 (in months)
People Required (P) = E / T (number of developers)
3. Project Effort and Cost Estimation
Assumptions for the Travel Agency Management System:
Estimated Lines of Code (LOC) = 7,000 LOC (7 KLOC)
Developer Salary = $3000 per month

4. Advantages and Disadvantages of COCOMO
✅ Advantages:
Simple and Easy to Use – Requires only LOC estimation.
Provides Cost and Time Estimates – Useful for planning resources.
Helps in Budgeting – Provides a rough idea of total project costs.
❌ Disadvantages:
Based on LOC Estimation – Hard to predict accurately in early stages.
Does Not Consider Agile Methodologies – Not suited for modern iterative development.
Limited Scope – Does not consider UI/UX design, testing, and deployment efforts.
5. Conclusion
The COCOMO model provides a structured approach to effort, time, and cost estimation. While it is useful for initial planning, modern software development often requires agile-based estimations (e.g., Function Points, Use Case Points).

Conclusion
The COCOMO model provides a systematic approach to estimating effort, time, and cost for software development. By applying the Basic COCOMO model to the Travel Agency Management System, we estimated that the project would require 18.12 person-months, approximately 7.8 months, and a team of 2–3 developers to complete. The estimated cost is $54,360, assuming a monthly developer salary of $3000.

While COCOMO offers a simple and structured estimation method, it has limitations, such as dependency on LOC estimation, lack of consideration for modern development practices, and exclusion of non-coding efforts like UI/UX design and testing.

For more accurate project estimation, alternative methods like Function Point Analysis (FPA), Use Case Points (UCP), or Agile-based story points can be considered. However, COCOMO remains a useful starting point for planning and budgeting software development projects.
